# analyze.py - analyze renderer thread time from a trace file.
#
# Usage:
#   1) Navigate to chrome://tracing, record a trace with the categories:
#      blink, cc, gpu, loading, mojom, toplevel, v8
#   2) In a new tab, navigate to some page.
#   3) In chrome://tracing, stop tracing and save the trace.
#   4) Uncompress the trace file with "gunzip [trace_file.json].gz".
#   5) Run analyze.py trace_file.json
